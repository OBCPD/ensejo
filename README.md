#About our group

We are a team of brazilian high schoolers sensibilized by our country's poor conditions in providing equality for the different gender, races and sexual orientation groups, hence we decided to create an equity project.

#What is our project   

Our app is called Ensejo, inspired by a Portuguese word which means opportunities. It is an app with the purpose to help our target users to find out about opportunities intended for them.

#Goal    

The Ensejo project has two goals in mind: the first one is creating a space to disclose opportunities for impoverished communities and individuals who suffer from social disadvantages, such as women, non-binary genders, indigenous and black people; the  second one is to engage people to join voluntary activities in order to help these groups and encourage donations to organizations focused on providings those initiatives.


#Features
 for instance, online courses designated for women, ethnic focused admission processes, gender inclusive actions or black empowerment projects

"Opportunities" - In the Opportunities feature, our app shows the available social programs related either to job applications or education.

"I want to help" - In the I want help section, users can find out about voluntary activities, donations for social projects or non-governmental organizations.

"Culture and Conscientization" - In the last one,YouTube channels and blogs created by minorities will be recommended, with the intention to provide meaningful content for anyone who wants to learn more about neglected cultures, racism, sexism or any type of discrimination. Additionally, users will be able to find out about protests and cultural events.

#Accessibility 

Based on the difficulties of access to low income people, we decided to create a completely free app, which is going to be available on Android and IOS, therefore, we could reach as many people as possible.

#Installation
npm instal / expo start
Our interface is quite intuitive and simple, as a result, users will be able to smoothly access all the app features and be delighted by the straightforward yet beautiful design.
